                single line of code other than stuff like not loading images from my C drive.

                <p> Actually my first dips in programming was probably on the Amiga 500 in the 1990s using AMOS. I made a really cool pong game with power-ups and other important things for a tween. Kinda fell off coding for... well, awhile. Better late than never?

                <p> Dabbled with HTML, CSS and Javascript for a decent chunk of my early career, but at some I realised I kinda liked making stuff with code, and perhaps I'd like it more if I actually knew what I was doing. Turns out the internet is a really good place to learn this for free. One of the first tutorials I did: <a>Creating a photo gallery</a>.    Exciting.

                <h3>#2 - My first blog layout </h3>
                <p> Now, armed with Code Academy, Free Code Camp, and Udemy, I started actually understanding how HTML and CSS worked. I learn best seeing it done, replicating and messing around with it. Every "intro to web development" course seems to have a different perspective. I would recommend doing theem all. Here is an early example of a blog layout I created. Developed my understanding of CSS some more and yes, I was proud of it!

                <p> "Well HTML and CSS are alright, but they aint, like, proper coding is it? How do you make it do stuff?" - Me, a while ago. Turns out that Javascript is really good at doing stuff on the web. One of my first dips into the water, a guessing game. You guess a number, the computer tells you if you are right or not. Back in my day this woud have kept kids entertained all day!</p>
